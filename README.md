# Unity Portfolio -- Interactive 3D Experience

This repository contains the source code for my interactive
**Unity-based portfolio**, a small open-world space where visitors can
walk around, interact with elements, and discover my featured projects
in an immersive way.

The experience is built to showcase both my **Unity development skills**
and my **game programming workflow**, including AI behavior systems,
animations, scene composition, UI, and performance optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Features

### 🐾 **Cat AI System**

A custom AI system featuring: - Autonomous roaming with NavMesh. - Jump
logic for climbing structures. - Idle, grooming, sleeping, and
exploration behavior. - Spline-based traversal for special movement
sequences. - State-machine driven animations.

### 🧍 **Active Ragdoll Character Controller**

The main character is implemented as a fully custom active ragdoll system developed from scratch.Building on those core principles, I created my own controller using real-time torque and force stabilization to maintain posture, balance, and locomotion.
This approach enables physics-driven movement with natural reactions to the environment, offering a more dynamic and responsive behavior than traditional animation-only controllers.

### 🌆 **Open Environment**

-   Fully walkable environment.
-   Interactive zones and triggers.
-   Optimized lighting and baked shadows for WebGL use.

### 🧭 **Navigation & Interaction**

-   Smooth first-person/third-person character controller.
-   Interactive UI menu with location teleports.
-   Scene transitions powered by DOTween animations.

### 🎨 **Custom Visual & UI Design**

-   Minimalist interface for navigation.
-   Animated menus and canvas interactions.
-   Optional WebGL build for quick preview.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

-   **Unity 2022--2023 (Built-in Render Pipeline)**
-   **C# -- Gameplay & AI Programming**
-   **NavMesh / NavMesh Agents**
-   **Spline Animation Logic**
-   **DOTween for transitions & UI**
-   **Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM)**
-   **WebGL Build Pipeline**

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## 🌐 WebGL Build

A WebGL version of the portfolio is available for easy preview in the
browser.\
(If you are a recruiter, you can skip the 3D experience and scroll
directly through the projects.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 How I Maintain This Repository

The active development is currently done using **Unity Version
Control**, and this GitHub repository acts as a public **mirror** of the
current project state.

Updates are pushed periodically to keep the showcase source code
visible.
